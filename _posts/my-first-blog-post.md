# My First Blog Post

This is my first blog post. I hope you like it!

I can write code like `print("Hello World")` in my blog post.

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

I can also write code in a separate file and include it in my blog post.

{% include_relative code.py %}

This blog post is written in Markdown. I can write **bold** or *italic* text.

Some of the main features of Markdown are:

  * It's easy to learn
  * It's easy to write
  * It's easy to read

I can also write a list:

    1. First item
    2. Second item
    3. Third item
